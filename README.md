# Interactive-rating-component
My solution for interactive-rating-component from frontendmentor

There is my first time uploading my work to github, and also my first frontend mentor challenge. I couldn't upload node_modules folder since it was too big, so I omitted it.
I build this solution by using React-vite, then Css module to style it.
